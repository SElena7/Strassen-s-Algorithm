# Strassen-s-Algorithm

This introduces the Strassen’s algorithm
for matrix multiplication and its sequential, parallel and
distributed implementation in Java. The conclusion of the
comparison of different modes of implementation of the
algorithm states that the parallel execution provides the best
results. Strassen’s algorithm gives results faster than the
standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices,
with a better asymptotic complexity, although the naive
algorithm is often better for smaller matrices.
